# Code Rules


- Always prefer simple solutions


- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality

- Keep security in mind to ensure less vulnerability of our platform.

- Use an MCP when need to complete task the best way without needing to be told

- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod


- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested


- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.


- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
